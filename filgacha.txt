Buwen is an auto-battler discord bot that allows you to roll for a variety of Filipino characters in gacha and use them to fight other characters.

"Buwen" is derived from the filipino word buwenas which means LUCK. This game's main mechanic will rely on luck in order to win against enemies or other players. Just a nifty little passion project I'm doing to test my development skills.
